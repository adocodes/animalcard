				<p>Raccoons are furry mammals who usually weigh in around 15 pounds, easily recognizable by their black “masks” on their faces. These critters are usually reddish-brown or gray, with alternating colored rings on their fluffy tails.

Primarily active at night, raccoons are often spotted rummaging through trash or pet food and invading Long Island homes to find safe, warm shelter to breed, especially during the colder months! In particular, raccoons love to get cozy in attics, crawl spaces, under decks, and inside walls and chimneys. Even though they’re cute, raccoons can cause some not-so-cute damage to your insulation, electrical wiring, and ventilation, which can ultimately lead to fires.</p>
